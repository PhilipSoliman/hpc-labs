# hpc-labs
This repo
- contains all code of hpc lab assignments + my answers;
- Additionally it processes output data from HPC labs
using Python's visualisation libraries; and
- contains my report.

The rest of this README is the original README of the HPC labs.

# Assignment HPC

This file contains a bunch of helper commands and links that you can find useful during your development on DelftBlue.

Please unzip the assignments folder and then add `<assignment_x>` folder from `HPC/<assignment_x>` in the `HPC` folder of your delftBlue. The assignments folders can be downloaded from BrightSpace.

Each assignment folders contains .sh file, this are files that contains slurm directive and tell DelftBlue how to compile and run your code. You can submit a job to the cluster by doing `sbatch ./HPC/<assigment_folder>/<program_name>.sh`

To change the directive for slurm, you need to modify the `<program_name>.sh` files. 
For example to run the code on 4 nodes `SBATCH --ntasks=4`.
Please look at [slurm directive docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for a details list of all options and their corresponding syntax
